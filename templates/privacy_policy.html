          <h2>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information collected by
            PropStart Pty Ltd via the website located at
            <a href="#">www.propstart.com.au</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>1. What is "personal information"?</h3>
          <p>
            The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) currently defines "personal information"
            as meaning information or an opinion about an identified individual
            or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
          </p>
          <p>(i) Whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</p>
          <p>
            (ii) Whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material
            form or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your
            identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified
            as "personal information" and will not be subject to this privacy
            policy.
          </p>
          <h3>2. What information do we collect?</h3>
          <p>
            The kind of personal information that we collect from you will
            depend on how you use the website. The personal information which we
            collect and hold about you may include: Full name, email address and
            contact number.
          </p>
          <h3>3. How we collect your personal information</h3>
          <p>
            We may collect personal information from you whenever you input such
            information into the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also collect cookies from your computer which enable us to tell
            when you use the website and also to help customise your website
            experience. As a general rule, however, it is not possible to
            identify you personally from our use of cookies.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Purpose of collection</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose for which we collect personal information is to provide
            you with the best service experience possible on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We customarily disclose personal information only to our service
            providers who assist us in operating the website. Your personal
            information may also be exposed from time to time to maintenance and
            support personnel acting in the normal course of their duties.

          <p>
            By using our website, you consent to the receipt of direct marketing
            material. We will only use your personal information for this
            purpose if we have collected such information direct from you, and
            if it is material of a type which you would reasonably expect to
            receive from us. We do not use sensitive personal information in
            direct marketing activity. Our direct marketing material will
            include a simple means by which you can request not to receive
            further communications of this nature.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Access and correction</h3>
          <p>
            Australian Privacy Principle 12 permits you to obtain access to the
            personal information we hold about you in certain circumstances, and
            Australian Privacy Principle 13 allows you to correct inaccurate
            personal information subject to certain exceptions. If you would
            like to obtain such access, please contact us as set out below.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Complaint procedure</h3>
          <p>
            If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain
            the privacy of your personal information, please contact us as set
            out below. All complaints will be considered by PropStart and we may

            remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter to
            the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
          </p>
          <h3>7. Overseas transfer</h3>
          <p>
            Your personal information may be transferred to recipients located
            in United States and Germany. United States and Germany has data
            protection laws which protect personal information in a way which is
            at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles,
            and there will be mechanisms available to you to enforce protection
            of your personal information under that overseas law. In the
            circumstances, we do not require the overseas recipients to comply
            with the Australian Privacy Principles and we will not be liable for
            a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles if your personal
            information is mishandled.
          </p>
